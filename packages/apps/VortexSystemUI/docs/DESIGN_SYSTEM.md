# Vortex OS Design System

## Design Philosophy

Vortex OS UI is built on the principles of:

1. **Fluidity** - Seamless transitions and animations
2. **Adaptability** - UI that responds to user and context
3. **Minimalism** - Clean, distraction-free interfaces
4. **Customization** - User control over appearance and behavior
5. **Accessibility** - Usable by everyone regardless of ability

## Core UI Components

### Color System

Vortex OS uses a dynamic color system that builds on Material You but extends it with:

- **Adaptive Palettes** - Colors that shift subtly based on time of day and usage context
- **Contrast Enhancement** - Intelligent contrast adjustment for better readability
- **Mood-based Themes** - Color schemes that adapt to user-defined moods or activities

Primary palette:
- Deep Space Blue (#0A1931)
- Nebula Purple (#5732FF)  
- Cosmic Teal (#00E0FF)
- Gravity Gray (#2D3142)

Accent colors:
- Vortex Orange (#FF6A00)
- Quantum Green (#00E676)
- Plasma Pink (#FF1493)

### Typography

Vortex OS uses a custom type system called "Vortex Sans" with:

- Variable font weight (200-900)
- Optimized for mobile displays
- High legibility at small sizes
- Support for multiple languages and scripts

Font sizes:
- Micro: 10sp
- Small: 12sp
- Medium: 14sp 
- Large: 16sp
- XLarge: 20sp
- XXLarge: 24sp
- Display: 34sp, 48sp, 60sp

### Iconography

Vortex Icon System features:
- Minimalist line-based approach
- Dynamic coloring based on system theme
- Subtle animations on interaction
- Consistent size grid (24dp base)
- High contrast modes for accessibility

### Spacing System

Based on 4dp grid with multipliers:
- Nano: 2dp
- Micro: 4dp
- Small: 8dp
- Medium: 16dp
- Large: 24dp
- XLarge: 32dp
- XXLarge: 48dp
- Huge: 64dp

## Interaction Model

### Gestures

Vortex OS introduces a multi-dimensional gesture system:

- **Edge Swipes** - Actions from screen edges
- **Multi-finger Gestures** - Two and three-finger interactions
- **Pressure Sensitivity** - Where hardware supports it
- **Hover Actions** - Context-aware actions before touch (on supported hardware)
- **Gesture Combinations** - Sequential gestures for power users

### Animations

All animations follow these principles:
- **Natural Physics** - Using realistic spring dynamics
- **Contextual Speed** - Faster for frequent actions, slower for new experiences
- **Spatial Continuity** - Elements maintain spatial relationships during transitions
- **Feedback Loops** - Visual and haptic feedback for all interactions

Duration guidelines:
- Micro interactions: 100-150ms
- Standard transitions: 200-300ms
- Emphasis animations: 400-500ms

### Haptics

A comprehensive haptic language including:
- Micro-feedback for typing
- Confirmation patterns
- Error alerts
- Success indicators
- Navigation cues

## Components Library

### Core Components

- **Vortex Cards** - Floating UI containers with dynamic shadows
- **Adaptive Buttons** - Shape-shifting action elements
- **Smart Lists** - Context-aware scrolling lists
- **Fluid Inputs** - Text fields with predictive enhancements
- **Quantum Switches** - Toggle elements with micro-animations
- **Horizon Sliders** - Value selection with haptic detents

### System UI Elements

- **Nebula Notifications** - Prioritized, actionable alerts
- **Quantum Quick Settings** - Context-aware system controls
- **Gravity Lock Screen** - Secure yet informative entry point
- **Stellar Status Bar** - Minimal yet information-rich

## Responsive Layouts

Vortex OS implements a fluid grid system that adapts to:
- Different screen sizes
- Device orientation changes
- Split-screen and foldable displays
- External display connections

Layout breakpoints:
- Compact: 0-599dp
- Medium: 600-959dp
- Expanded: 960+dp

## Accessibility Features

- **Contrast Modes** - Enhanced visibility options
- **Motion Reduction** - For those sensitive to animations
- **Screen Reader Optimization** - Comprehensive TalkBack support
- **Alternative Navigation** - Switch control and voice navigation
- **Text Scaling** - 200-700% text size adjustment
