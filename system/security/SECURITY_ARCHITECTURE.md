# Vortex OS Security Architecture

## Security Philosophy

Vortex OS is built with a **Security-First** approach that combines:

1. **Zero Trust Model** - No process or application is trusted by default
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Proactive Protection** - AI-driven threat prevention
4. **Privacy by Design** - Data minimization and user control
5. **Memory Safety** - Rust-based components to eliminate memory vulnerabilities

## Core Security Components

### Secure Boot Chain

- **Verified Boot** - Enhanced implementation of Android Verified Boot
- **Hardware-backed Key Storage** - Integration with Secure Element/TPM
- **Boot Integrity Monitoring** - Runtime verification of boot components
- **Anti-Rollback Protection** - Prevention of downgrade attacks

### Kernel Security

- **Kernel Hardening**
  - Memory protections (KASLR, CFI, SCS)
  - System call filtering
  - Structure layout randomization
  - Restricted memory access

- **SELinux Enhancements**
  - Custom policy modules for Vortex components
  - Fine-grained domain separation
  - Comprehensive audit logging
  - Policy verification tools

### Sandboxing

- **Application Isolation**
  - Enhanced process sandboxing
  - Rust-based sandbox implementation
  - Resource access controls
  - Inter-process communication restrictions

- **Namespaces and Cgroups**
  - Per-application network namespaces
  - Resource control via cgroups v2
  - Mount namespace restrictions
  - PID namespace isolation

### Encryption

- **File-Based Encryption (FBE)**
  - Per-file encryption keys
  - Multiple encryption levels
  - Hardware-backed key derivation
  - Secure key storage in hardware

- **Network Encryption**
  - DNS-over-HTTPS as default
  - TLS 1.3 enforcement
  - Certificate transparency checking
  - HTTPS-only application connections

### Permissions Framework

- **Dynamic Permissions**
  - Context-aware permission grants
  - Temporary permissions with auto-expiry
  - Granular permission control
  - Permission usage transparency

- **Sensitive Data Access**
  - One-time permissions
  - Location accuracy control
  - Data access auditing
  - Privacy indicators
